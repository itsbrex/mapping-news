      Local journalism is in crisis.{" "}
      <Link href="https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/fact-sheet/local-newspapers/">
        Subscription revenue is in freefall
      </Link>{" "}
      and outlets can barely cover basic community issues with the resources
      they have. According to Pew, “at a time when{" "}
      <Link href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/11/28/audiences-are-declining-for-traditional-news-media-in-the-us-with-some-exceptions/">
        many local news outlets are struggling

      and{" "}

        Americans’ trust in the news media
      </Link>{" "}
      has waned, the vast majority of U.S. adults (85%) say local news outlets
      are at least somewhat important to the well-being of their local
      community.”
    </p>
    <p>
      This crisis has{" "}
      <Link href="https://www.usnewsdeserts.com/reports/expanding-news-desert/loss-of-local-news/">
        several downstream effects
      </Link>
      , including “
      <Link href="https://www.usnewsdeserts.com/reports/expanding-news-desert/">
        news deserts
      </Link>
      ” — areas of the country that receive <em>no</em> coverage because all of
      their outlets have closed. Northwestern University’s Medill School “
      <Link href="https://localnewsinitiative.northwestern.edu/">
        Local News Initiative
      </Link>
      ” tracks local outlets, and{" "}
      <Link href="https://localnewsinitiative.northwestern.edu/projects/state-of-local-news/2024/report/">
        releases an annual report
      </Link>{" "}
      analyzing local news coverage county-by-county across the US.{" "}
      <Link href="https://localnewsinitiative.northwestern.edu/projects/state-of-local-news/explore/#/localnewslandscape">
        It states that
      </Link>{" "}
      “There are 206 counties in the United States with no news outlets,”
      according to the initiative, and 1,558 counties only have one.{" "}
    </p>
    <p>
      This data has been invaluable to understanding the state of local news
      coverage and the consequences of news deserts are well-documented.
      However, I wanted to look beyond the physical spread of local outlets, and
      bring attention not just to the counties that have just one or two.{" "}
    </p>
    <p>
      My theory is that not all communities are treated equally when coverage is
      low and resources are spread thin. Could a county-level newspaper, for
      instance, focus a significant amount of coverage on the county seat, but
      miss happenings in other population centers spread miles away? If so, how
      could we know?
    </p>
    <p>
      This project aims to examine this problem by mapping the locations
      mentioned in local news articles in one region — New York City. Why? It’s
      where I live right now, but more importantly, it&#39;s one of the most{" "}
      <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_New_York_City_newspapers_and_magazines">
        journalism-heavy environments
      </Link>{" "}
      in the US. Moreover, many of the edge cases that would exist expanding
      this data to cover the rest of the country can be identified and addressed
      here. For instance, New Yorkers have their choice of corporate media (both
      print and TV), <Link href="https://www.thecity.nyc/">nonprofit</Link> and{" "}
      <Link href="https://hellgatenyc.com/">worker-owned</Link> outlets,
      non-English print-only publications and hyper-local, small-circulation
      dailies. We have duplicate addresses within coverage areas (Fifth Avenue
      in Brooklyn versus Manhattan), ambiguous locations like universities and
      hospitals, local names and landmarks, outlets with overlapping coverage
      areas, and more. That’s to say, the work is clear to expand this project
      more broadly.{" "}

      and temporarily store them. The script runs more frequently during the

      <li>
        At this moment, we can only use publications that have working RSS

      </li>
      <li>
        We did our best to filter feeds by their metro/local reporting, when
        relevant. That could leave state- or federal-level news stories that
        have local impact off the map.{" "}
